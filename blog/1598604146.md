# How to set Featured Image for scully blog

When you want to create a post list, you can access all routes using ScullyRoutesService. But if you want to set featured image on each post, how to access the featured image url.

![post list image](/assets/blog/1598643132.jpg)

## Purpose

- To access featured image url using ScullyRoutesService.
- To understand scully-routes.json file.

## ScullyRoutesService

When you create a post with scully, the created markdown file has a frontmatter. We used the description data in a frontmatter before ([Scully and meta description](/blog/1598464261)).

When Scully makes `scully-routes.json` which used as `ScullyRoutes[]`, a frontmatter was stored into HandledRoute.data ([HandledRoute](https://github.com/scullyio/scully/blob/main/libs/scully/src/lib/routerPlugins/handledRoute.interface.ts)) in a process. After that the data will be exported into the `scully-routes.json` file. So, you can define any string data into frontmatter, then you can access that from ScullyRoutesService.

At this time, we need featured image url data in a post. So I'm going to define `featured_image` in a frontmatter.

```markdown
---
title: "How to make awesome post"
description: "Beep Beep Boop..."
featured_image: '/assets/img/tanb-express.jpg'
published: ture
---
```

Let's check the scully-routes.json. If you didn't run a sully server, please run the server with watch mode as follows:

```bash
yarn scully --watch
```

The `scully-routes.json` file will be created in `./dist/static/assets` directory. You will find the featured_image data in the `scully-routes.json`.

## Additional definition of ScullyRoute interface

After defined new frontmatter data, you can access that from ScullyRoutesService. The created or updated `scully-routes.json` will used as `ScullyRoute[]`. But `ScullyRoute` interface is defined with a few properties simply ([ScullyRoute](https://github.com/scullyio/scully/blob/main/libs/ng-lib/src/lib/route-service/scully-routes.service.ts)).

To access additional data, you need to define interface. Thankfully, TypeScript can define multiple same named interfaces and those will be merged. So I define this interface in a PostListComponent.

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { ScullyRoutesService } from '@scullyio/ng-lib';
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';

interface ScullyRoute {
  description: string;
  featured_image?: string;
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-post-list',
  templateUrl: './post-list.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./post-list.component.scss']
})
export class PostListComponent implements OnInit {
  blog$ = this.srs.available$
    .pipe(
      map((routes) => {
        return routes.filter((route) => {
          return route.route.startsWith('/blog/')
        }).reverse();
      })
    );

  constructor(private srs: ScullyRoutesService) { }

  ngOnInit(): void {
  }
}
```

```html
<li *ngFor="let blog of blog$ | async">
  <img [attr.src]="blog.featured_image">
</li>
```


## Conclusion

You can access any data in a frontmatter through ScullyRoutesService. Featured image, author, tags or creation date, you can define any data in a frontmatter as you like. Bt now I'm just considering that may be scully-routes.json will be huge some day. For now, It may be best to avoid putting unnecessary data in the frontmatter...
